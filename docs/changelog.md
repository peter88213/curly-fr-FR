### Version 3.4.1

Replacing closing single quotes with apostrophes, if placed within word boundaries.

Based on curly 3.4.1

### Version 3.4.0

The apostrophe substitution character was changed from a number sign to an acute accent.

> [!TIP]
> If you'd like to use a different replacement character instead, you can edit the BASIC code in the **Common** module and change this constant:
> 
> ```Basic
> Public Const ChApostropheSubst = "´"
> ```
> If you want to continue using the number sign, you'll just have to stick with version 3.3.x.
